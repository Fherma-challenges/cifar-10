# CIFAR-10 CHALLENGE

## Imputing Your Solution

All you have to do is put your solution in the function `SolveTestcase`, which is located in the file `internal/solution/solution.go`.

## Testing Your Solution Locally

- `$ make test-all` to do an end-to-end test of your solution followed by a clean of the temporary files
- `$ make setup` to generate the keys and input ciphertext
- `$ make solution` to run the solution and verify it (assumes that the keys and input ciphertext have been generated)
- `$ make clean` to clean the temporary files

## Packaging & Submitting Your Solution

Simply create a `.zip` containing the folder `app` and submit it on the website.
